### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    From Lab 6, my favorite part was part two, where we had to develop a game of Blackjack through C++.
    While the game itself is straightforward, it was much more difficult to visualize and program,
    since my partner and I had to really think about how to assign the cards their numerical values.
    However, I really liked seeing how intertwined the functions file and the main file were, as
    programming both was important to getting the whole program to work. Notably, I learned how to
    properly write conditional statements within an if statement. This knowledge stemmed from when my
    code kept having errors until I addressed those syntax errors.

* Lab 7

    In Lab 7, my favorite section of the lab was part two, where we had to identify what times
    someone could park on different streets. This was fun to tackle, because it forced my
    partner and I to really think about the correct conditional statements that would allow a car to
    park on certain streets. This taught me how crucial it is to trace code, as we would not have been
    able to reason out some of the streets' times without first writing it out, and slowly processing
    through each case.

* Lab 10

    Within the Lab 10 content, my favorite was part two. While it was a lot more difficult compared to what we
    have completed before that lab, the difficulty proved to be interesting. Working around 2D vectors was
    a tough experience, as it was initially hard to visualize the 2D matrix. However, once the program was
    completed, it was a very rewarding feeling, and why I liked that part so much. This part really made
    me have to understand how 2D vectors functioned, as well as how to maneuver and access specific
    parts of those vectors.
